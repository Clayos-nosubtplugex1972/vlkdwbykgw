Oh man, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Opus! Like, what even was that?? Seriously, it was like my brain took a rollercoaster ride and then just casually decided to flip itself inside out, you know what I mean? I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   thinking it would just be a chill evening after the massage sessions, but nope! Totally underestimated it.

> The plot was wild. One minute you're just vibing with the character, next something insane happens. I mean, how do they even come up with these things? Do the writers just sit in a room and throw random ideas at the wall? 🤣 I was like, whoa, hold up, what? The visuals though, stunning, like, eye candy mixed with a mind trip, but guess that’s what they were going for.

And don’t even get me started on the soundtrack. Felt like I was back in the spa with those weird ambient mixes that put you in a trance but also low-key annoy you by the third replay 😂. But yeah, definitely turns your brain to mush in the best kind of way. Tried to explain a scene to a client today, and halfway through, I just kinda gave up, like whatever, they need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   themselves to get it, right?

Anyway, I was left both confused and oddly satisfied. Like I should’ve been more prepared? Who knows. Now my head’s buzzing, and I have a session early tomorrow. Wish me luck getting up without the bells and whistles from that soundtrack haunting my morning routine. Ah, the life of trying to unwind while 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 WHATTHEHECK cinema.

But hey, let’s plan a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 party soon, yeah?! I need a buddy to scream at the screen with and maybe make sense of this chaos together, lol. Hit me up, for real.
